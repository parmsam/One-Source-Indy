### Quick info:
This R program uses social services data to create an open source app intended to better inform in-need homeless or unstably-housed individuals  living in Indianapolis on what is available in our communities. App code is in the prototype folder. 

Also included is a web scraping program that was used to pull Chip Indy Handbook for Help Data (http://www.handbookofhelp.org/)
### Goal:
To improve connection to care and health of homeless community members through better access to resource information.
